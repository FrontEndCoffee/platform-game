# Platform-Game dependencies

The following dependencies should be installed on your machine:

## 1. Node Package Manager (npm) and Node (node)

### 1.1 Installation

Acquire node Node Package Manager (`npm`) [here](https://www.npmjs.com/)  
For npm: Version 3.9.x or above  
For node: Version 6.x or above

We recommend you acquire this using Node Version Manager (`nvm`) [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

nvm install stable
```

This should get you the latest versions of npm and node.

Use the following commands to verify your install:

```bash
npm --version #Should return 3.9.x
node --version #Should return v6.x
```
